# 🏗️ I3M Platform Architecture Update

## 📋 Migration Summary (29/09/2025)

### **🎯 Business Operating System (BOS) Philosophy**

I3M Platform đã được restructure theo triết lý "Business Operating System":
- **ERP Services**: Kernel (Core Business Logic)
- **Industry Services**: Applications (Industry-specific)
- **Core Services**: System Services (Infrastructure)
- **Integration Layer**: API Gateway, Service Mesh, Event Bus

---

## **🔧 Changes Made**

### **1. Service Reorganization**

#### **✅ ERP Services (Core Business Logic)**
```
erp-services/
├── commerce-service/          # Business logic for all industries
├── cms-service/              # Content management for all channels
├── analytics-services/        # Business intelligence
├── hrm-service/              # Human resources
├── finance-service/           # Accounting
├── crm-service/              # Customer management
├── inventory-service/         # Inventory management
├── procurement-service/       # Procurement
└── integration-service/       # Integration
```

#### **✅ Industry Services (Industry-specific Applications)**
```
industry-services/
├── ecommerce-service/         # Headless multi-channel commerce
├── agriculture-service/       # Farm management
├── healthcare-service/        # Clinic + Telemedicine
├── retail-service/           # POS + Online + Mobile
├── restaurant-service/        # Dine-in + Delivery + Takeaway
└── manufacturing-service/     # B2B + B2C + Distributor
```

### **2. Key Architectural Changes**

#### **🔄 Ecommerce Service Migration**
- **From**: `erp-services/ecommerce-service/` (Core Business)
- **To**: `industry-services/ecommerce-service/` (Industry Application)
- **Reason**: Ecommerce is industry-specific, not core business logic

#### **🔄 Analytics Services Integration**
- **From**: Separate `analytics-services/` directory
- **To**: `erp-services/analytics-services/` (Core Business)
- **Reason**: Analytics is core business intelligence

#### **🔄 CMS Services Integration**
- **From**: Separate `content-services/` directory
- **To**: `erp-services/cms-service/` (Core Business)
- **Reason**: Content management is core business function

### **3. API Gateway Updates**

#### **✅ New Routing Structure**
```yaml
# ERP Services (Core Business)
/api/v1/erp/commerce/*        # Business logic
/api/v1/erp/cms/*             # Content management
/api/v1/erp/analytics/*        # Business intelligence
/api/v1/erp/hr/*              # Human resources
/api/v1/erp/finance/*         # Accounting
/api/v1/erp/crm/*             # Customer management

# Industry Services (Applications)
/api/v1/industry/ecommerce/*   # Headless multi-channel
/api/v1/industry/agriculture/* # Farm management
/api/v1/industry/healthcare/*  # Clinic + Telemedicine
/api/v1/industry/retail/*      # POS + Online + Mobile
/api/v1/industry/restaurant/*  # Dine-in + Delivery
/api/v1/industry/manufacturing/* # B2B + B2C
```

## **📊 Benefits of New Architecture**

### **✅ Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **ERP Services**: Core business logic cho tất cả industries
- **Industry Services**: Industry-specific applications
- **Core Services**: Infrastructure services

### **✅ Scalability**
- **Easy to add new industries**: Just create new industry service
- **Core business logic shared**: All industries use same ERP services
- **Independent scaling**: Each service can scale independently

### **✅ Maintainability**
- **Clear boundaries**: Easy to understand what each service does
- **Reduced coupling**: Services are loosely coupled
- **Easier testing**: Each service can be tested independently

### **✅ Business Value**
- **Faster time to market**: New industries can be added quickly
- **Cost effective**: Shared core business logic
- **Flexible**: Easy to customize for specific industries
